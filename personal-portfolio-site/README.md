# Personal PortFolio 

![Portfolio Logo](images-readme.md/img-logo-1x.svg)

This is a digital *Personal PortFolio*. A platform where one can showcase the following: education history, work experience, skills, relevant competencies, hobbies & interests, personal and contact information. This site is open for viewing and collaboration from the general public as well as potential employment possibilities from recruiters.

The site can be navigated using the following pages:
```
 Home
 About 
 Education
 Work 
 PortFolio 
 Contact
 Downloads
```

In addition, the page called *PortFolio* has a heading labelled **Projects Gallery** solely dedicated to screenshots of complete projects with a link icon below the image which directs the viewer to that particular site. Here the user can showcase their abilities and capabilities with regards to their respective line of work.

## UX

 As a user I want to my PortFolio to be easy to navigate and understand so that the user is able to have a pleasant experience while navigating the site.

 This site is a design template for a user interested in creating their own *Digital Personal PortFolio*. It has been split into 7 pages namely: *Home, About, Education, Work, PortFolio, Contact* and *Downloads*.

 In order to achieve this I began by drawing up a sketch of how the site would look like as shown in this link [Site PDF Mockup](images-readme.md/personal-portfolio-site-layouts.pdf)
