## Technologies Used in this Build

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) &mdash; The Front-End web Framework used

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Old+Standard+TT?sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Josefin+Sans|Jost|Old+Standard+TT&query=old+st) &mdash; The Font Families used

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) &mdash; Troubleshooting

## Testing

- [html5 Validator](https://validator.nu/) &mdash; validating html5 files

- [W3c Markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/) &mdash; validating html files

- [CSS Validator](http://www.css-validator.org/) &mdash; validating CSS files

- The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) Framework has built in media queries which can be used to style the site so as to fit the devices that it is being viewed on.

- Automated Testing for mobile version using [Google Lighthouse ext](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) 

- Testing was also conducted manually whereby friends and family browsed clicked the link sent and navigated through the site on various devices and gave their feedback in the process of making this site. 

- [Bootstrap Media Queries](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/overview/) allows me to stack the content into a single column on smaller devices such as smartphones; single and double columns on tablets and single, double or more columns on larger devices.

One bug that I have encountered in my testing  is in my timeline html file. [(X)HTML5 validation results for booking.html bug](images/bug-screenshots-images/bug-booking-html-validation.pdf)

## Credits

### Content


- CSS Animations used were inspired by documentation from the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)

- Accordion Collapse to display the education history was copied from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/collapse/)

### Media

The image placeholder slides used in this project are in the SVG format and were drawn by myself using adobe Xd. Equally the logo is also in SVG format and was designed by myself using Adobe Illustrator. 

### Acknowledgements

My biggest inspiration with this project is to create a platform that the user can be able to get as much Information about holiday Packages and the vast experiences that the country has to offer as an open invitation for the user to consider taking a vacation there.
